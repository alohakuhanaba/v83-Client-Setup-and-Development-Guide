### Core setup
This guide assumes you followed the server setup guide for your respective v83 server source up until the point you need the localhost/client. Instead of using the provided localhost, download the following:  

- compiled ezorsia v2 dll from https://github.com/444Ro666/v83-Client-Setup-and-Development-Guide/releases  follow the instructions in the readme to install it (source is also released for transparency and development)
- hendi's v83 4g client with admin elevation request removed from https://www.mediafire.com/file/m0xrxzsvrt0qkue/GMSv83_4GB%2528no_admin_req%2529.exe/file this is the only edit that was made to the binary directly because i could not get it to work from the dll
    - if you would rather do the edit yourself for verification purposes you can get the original release version from https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/localhost-workshop.1202021/ you will also need the to use the hex edittor from cosmic files https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hgnb92MGL6xqEp9szEMBh0K9pSJcJ6IT and make the following edits https://www.mediafire.com/view/2jdmfszadkzpn49/2023-09-12-100911_1295x227_scrot.png/file#
    - mirror for clean, uneditted 4g client in case it ever becomes unavailable: https://www.mediafire.com/file/00wq8c2boux83ys/GMSv83_4GB.exe/file
